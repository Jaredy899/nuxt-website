# Welcome to My Blog

This is going to be my thoughts on anything and everything. It's mainly a way of playing with website building.

* 💻 Building websites
* 🖖🏽 Star Trek
* ✈️ Airplanes
* 🧠 Mental Health
* 📰 Politics
* 🎹 Music

I built this website using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) and [View Transitions](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/transitions).

This post itself is written in Markdown.

## What I Used to Build This Blog

Here are some of the key ingredients that went into making this blog:

* **Nuxt:** The framework powering the whole thing. I'm really impressed with how fast and easy it is to work with. I'm building this project in several different frameworks. So far Astro and Nuxt are my favorite.
* **Markdown:** For writing all the content (like this post!). It's so simple and effective.
* **View Transitions:** To create those smooth animations when you click between pages. It's a really nice touch!
* **Custom Styling:** I've added some personal touches to the design to make it my own.
* **Cursor:** Of course, I vibe coded it... All while learning how to do it more myself.

```js
// A little code snippet to show off code blocks!
const greeting = "Hello, Nuxt Blog!";
console.log(greeting);
```
